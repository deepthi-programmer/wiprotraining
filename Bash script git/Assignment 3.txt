Ensure you are on the 'main' branch:
git checkout main
Create a new branch named 'hotfix':
git checkout -b hotfix
Make the necessary fixes in the 'hotfix' branch. Edit your files to resolve the issue.

Add the changes to the staging area:
git add .
Commit the changes:
git commit -m "Fixed issue in hotfix branch"
Switch back to the 'main' branch:
git checkout main
Merge the 'hotfix' branch into the 'main' branch:
git merge hotfix
After ensuring the merge is successful and the issue is resolved, you can optionally delete the 'hotfix' branch:
git branch -d hotfix
