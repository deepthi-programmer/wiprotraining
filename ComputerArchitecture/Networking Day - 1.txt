Assignment 1: 

* Draw your Home Network Topology and explain how you are accessing the RPS Lab environment.
  Home Network Topology:
	
Components:

•	ISP Modem: This is the device provided by your Internet Service Provider (ISP)
                   that connects your home network to the Internet.
•	Router: The router acts as the central hub of your home network, 
                managing connections between devices and providing access to the Internet. 
                It may include built-in Wi-Fi capabilities and multiple Ethernet ports.
•	Switch: A switch can be used to expand the number of Ethernet ports 
                available for wired connections within your home network.
•	Access Point (AP): The access point provides wireless connectivity for devices that support Wi-Fi,
                          extending the coverage of your home network.
•	Devices: Various devices connect to your home network, including computers, smartphones, 
                 tablets, smart TVs, printers, and smart home devices.
	
Topology:

•	The home network typically follows a star topology, with all devices connected to the central router.
•	Devices may connect to the router via wired Ethernet connections (using Ethernet cables)
        or wirelessly through the access point (using Wi-Fi).

                 [Devices Wired]   [Devices Wireless]

1.	Bus Topology:

•	In a bus topology, all devices are connected to a single central cable, called the bus or backbone.
•	Devices communicate with each other by sending data along the bus.
•	Advantages: Simple and inexpensive to set up, suitable for small networks with few devices.
•	Disadvantages: Susceptible to cable failures, network slowdowns if multiple devices attempt to transmit simultaneously, difficult to troubleshoot.

2.	Ring Topology:

•	In a ring topology, each device is connected to exactly two other devices, forming a closed loop or ring.
•	Data travels around the ring in one direction, passing through each device until it reaches its destination.
•	Advantages: Simple and easy to install, efficient data transmission with minimal collisions.
•	Disadvantages: Vulnerable to cable or device failures, a single point of failure can disrupt the entire network, 
        difficult to add or remove devices without disrupting the network.

3.	Mesh Topology:

•	In a mesh topology, each device is connected to every other device in the network, forming a fully interconnected mesh.
•	Data can travel along multiple paths, increasing reliability and fault tolerance.
•	Advantages: High redundancy and fault tolerance, efficient data transmission, scalable and flexible.
•	Disadvantages: Expensive and complex to set up, requires a large number of cables and ports, difficult to manage and troubleshoot.

4.	Star Topology:

•	In a star topology, all devices are connected to a central hub or switch, forming a star-like configuration.
•	Data travels through the central hub, which manages communication between devices.
•	Advantages: Simple and easy to set up, centralized management, easy to add or remove devices without disrupting the network.
•	Disadvantages: Dependency on the central hub, if the hub fails, the entire network may become inaccessible, limited scalability.

5.	Hybrid Topology:

•	A hybrid topology combines two or more different network topologies, such as a combination of star and mesh or star and ring.
•	Hybrid topologies are often used to leverage the strengths of multiple topologies and address specific network requirements.
•	Advantages: Provides flexibility and customization, allows for optimization of network performance and reliability.
•	Disadvantages: Increased complexity, may require additional hardware and management overhead.

2.	Accessing the RPS Lab Environment:

•	Remote Access: If the RPS lab environment is hosted remotely, you can access it from your home network 
                       using remote access technologies such as Virtual Private     Network (VPN) or Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).
•	VPN: You can set up a VPN connection from your home network to the RPS lab environment, 
              which allows you to securely access lab resources as if you were physically connected to the lab network.
•	RDP: Alternatively, if the lab environment provides a Windows-based interface, you can use Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) 
              to connect to a remote Windows server or workstation within the lab environment and interact with lab resources remotely.
•	Configuration: To set up remote access, you may need to configure your home network router to allow 
                       VPN passthrough or port forwarding, depending on the specific requirements of the remote lab environment.
•	Security: Ensure that you follow best practices for securing your remote access connections, 
                 such as using strong encryption, implementing multi-factor authentication, and keeping your VPN and RDP clients up to date with security patches.
